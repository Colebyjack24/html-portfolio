  <h2>My Journey</h2>
  <hr>
    <p>Originally from Sacramento, CA, I grew up with an inclination for creativity. 
    I explore sounds and ideas that look beautiful to my eye. I developed these skills while
    going through High School where I was following the path of the Engineering Academy, normally, this would lead students to
    enroll in a University Engineering Undergraduate program, however under pressure frome exestential fear of life becoming "boring"
    I chose to look for another career path. While my desire remained to drop out and make music, I never really wanted to dissapoint how much money my parents
    put into my education. 
    <p>So while studying to get a degree in Community Health Sciences I maintained a constant pulse with
    local music scenes in Reno, NV where I went to school. I became a successful music producer for other artists on the side.
    I found my passion regardless even if it wasn't paying all the bills. I graduated right before COVID and fell into an open market
    for employment so I could continue to explore career paths which again I switched to something I felt would give me leverage into 
    a career involved with creativity. 
    <p>Here I am before you  in an IT career writing an about me section on a HTML website.
    In this journey I found Jesus, friends, highs, lows, a beautiful smart wife, an amazing child, and a comfort beyond compare 
    getting to make what I love and do things that are interesting. If you'd like to contact me for any music inquiries or creative endeavors, <a href="./contact.html">click here.</a>
